Having worked non-stop since August 2018, the team at Veil Project couldn’t be more excited to announce that **as of January 1, 2019m the Veil Mainnet has officially launched!**.

Although there is still much work to be done:

- You can [download the core wallet for Linux and Windows](https://veil-project.com/get-started/) immediately. (MacOS X will soon follow.)

- You can [download miner software](https://veil-project.com/mining/) for NVIDIA and AMD, and [start mining at one of the available pools](https://veil-project.com/mining/).

We’ll have more announcements and documentation online soon, but as always, if you need any support, don’t hesitate to reach out in the [Official Veil Discord](https://discord.veil-project.com).

Best regards,

The Veil Team
