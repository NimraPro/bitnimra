Visit the TradeOgre bitcoin-veil market [here](https://tradeogre.com/exchange/BTC-VEIL).

TradeOgre has been a long requested exchange within the Veil community, and is a popular choice for miners. The exchange, as mentioned, has no KYC requirements, no limits, and charges withdrawal fees based on the network rather than a flat BTC cost.

With the recent PoW fork introducing wallet version 1.1 consensus changes, we remind you to have your [wallet updated to 1.1.0](https://github.com/Veil-Project/veil/releases) if you intend to trade on TradeOgre or any other exchange. Any wallets that are not on the correct chain will not be able to send or receive veil successfully.

Any questions regarding 1.1 and exchanges supporting Veil are welcome on Discord or social media.
