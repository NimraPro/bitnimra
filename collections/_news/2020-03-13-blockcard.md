Shop at over 45 million merchants: Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Debit Cards just around the corner!

Thanks to [Ternio BlockCard]( https://getblockcard.com/), Veil Project will soon be the first privacy focused blockchain with a debit card usable anywhere major credit cards are accepted worldwide! That’s over 45 million merchants with the added convenience of Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay all in one. 

Our friends at BitMart are helping us celebrate, in conjunction with their 2 year anniversary, by holding a [100,000 VEIL deposit bonus and trading competition](https://bitmart.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360044826353-Veil-Deposit-Bonus-and-Trading-Competition-100-000-VEIL-in-Prizes-). Join us in counting down to this major milestone and important step toward fulfilling our vision. 

If trading isn’t your thing, don’t forget about [our 10k giveaway](https://twitter.com/ProjectVeil/status/1233074317212012545) — winners drawn when our debit card goes live.

Good luck and stay tuned!
