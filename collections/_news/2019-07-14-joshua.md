Veil HQ is excited to announce that lifelong-privacy enthusiast, Joshua Marriage, will be joining Veil as the Head of Business Development. 

Joshua is a founding partner of Privacy Express, a venture studio focused on helping privacy enhancing technologies find product-market fit. Their flagship project, Pip, enhances consumer applications with next-level personal data privacy, security and convenience.

With experience as an international speaker at events such as Anarchapulco, Joshua has been a long-time privacy advocate, previously serving as Global Spokesperson for CloakCoin.

Joshua started his career as an electrotechnologist, later moving into computer systems engineering, and eventually finding his way to crypto as many did: through a curiosity for the dark markets. After a beard-related venture, a brush with online fame and first-hand experience being compromised, he turned his full attention to privacy.

Please help us in welcoming Joshua to the team! Welcome aboard!
