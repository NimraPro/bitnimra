Until recent decades, we've invariably taken privacy for granted. Only the occasional Peeping Tom or tattletale have spoiled it. Espionage has a storied history, but seals and encryption are traditional tools of kings and armies, not civilians. That's changed with the dawn of the information age. From targeted phishing to [Cambridge Analytica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal), we're quickly discovering how invasive life in a world with the internet can be.

Progress halts for nobody, so where does the buck stop for privacy in this surging information age? This piece seeks to provide an answer to that question, and it may not be one you'd expect.

# Part 1: Resolving the identity of privacy

Before we assign responsibility for privacy to any party, let's ensure we understand privacy. Part 1 tackles privacy as a concept, looking at how it has been defined, and how we may perhaps better define it.

## What is privacy?

[Meriam-Webster]( https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/privacy)  defines privacy as:

* **a** *the quality or state of being apart from company or observation*
* **b** *freedom from unauthorized intrusion*

Together, the two definitions imply *isolation excepting permitted parties*. The word can be traced back to the [Old French](https://www.etymonline.com/word/privacy) *privauté* and [Latin](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=private) *privatus* used for secrecy and solitude.

In Chinese privacy is written as 隐私, with the separate characters 隐 meaning *hidden* and 私 meaning *private*. Written Chinese is an enduring language. These samples show the concept of privacy as spanning both the Western and Eastern world well into human history.

## Why does it matter?

Why is privacy important though? The noun *privy*, sharing [etymology roots](https://www.etymonline.com/word/privy) with privacy, has been used for a toilet for many centuries. Privacy at such a time shields us from shame, indignation, and of course [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paruresis) in the heightened state of vulnerability.

The application of privacy is not, however, homogeneous globally. The call for privacy in different circumstances [depends on culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law). The Japanese, for example, are relatively open with nudity. Despite any vulnerability it presents, the Japanese bathe nude in public baths, even [mixing sexes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onsen#Mixed_bathing) in some scenarios. The character 私 used for *private* in Chinese is used in Japanese as *I/me*. This is fitting for a culture so reluctant to share thoughts and feelings. What necessitates privacy varies between cultures, but the privacy concept is metaculturally present.

Protection of property is another objective of privacy. The erecting of barriers to dissuade unauthorized entry is commonplace nowadays. To some, the idea this hasn't historically been the standard may seem unusual. The further we've differentiated ourselves from our ape ancestors, the more materialistically covetous we've become. With that advancement have come security devices, from [simple knots to detect tampering](http://www.historyofkeys.com/locks-history/history-of-locks/), to wooden bolts, pin tumblers, and more recently biometric smart locks.

Another facet of privacy is the protection of, and freedom to selectively portray, our individual character image. [The Simpsons made a gag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtP7qLWUmfs) years ago that innocently highlights how an invasion of privacy can bring about shame and indignation. Suffice to say, most everyone has things they'd prefer the outside world didn't know about themselves, be they predilection, bodily differences, associations, or otherwise.

So to answer the question, privacy is important because it protects something belonging to an individual, the loss of which would cause anything from an inconvenience to a threat to the individual's well-being.

## The trouble with defining privacy

By the above, privacy might then be defined in short as ** *freedom to maintain secrecy in matters pertaining to oneself* **. While that definition may have carried adequate verisimilitude in the past, a more robust understanding of privacy is needed. To better navigate the information age, the world needs a fitting definition to which we can all prescribe.

In 1980, Jack Hirshleifer [offered an analogy](https://www.jstor.org/stable/724176?seq=1) likening defining privacy to explorers mistakenly charting the expanses of a new continent. Within he posits that privacy is not simply "the idea of secrecy", but rather "**autonomy within society**".

Hirshleifer was one of the first to challenge the conventional definition of privacy, but the problem of redefining it has persisted. Take the following quote:

> *In spite of the several attempts that have been made to define privacy; no universal definition
of privacy could be created. Despite the fact that the claim for privacy in (sic) universal, its concrete
form differs according to the prevailing societal characteristics, the economic and cultural
environment.*

Here Adrienn Lukács highlights masterfully the problem. [Read the full paper here](http://publicatio.bibl.u-szeged.hu/10794/7/3188699.pdf).

[Privacy International](https://privacyinternational.org/explainer/56/what-privacy) defines privacy as:

> Privacy is a fundamental right, essential to autonomy and the protection of human dignity, serving as the foundation upon which many other human rights are built.

This is not particularly novel in the face of what we've already explored. The following addendum they provide however is valuable:

> The rules that protect privacy give us the ability to assert our rights in the face of significant power imbalances.

Privacy should be afforded anyone without force of any kind posing a threat, so running contrarily to a [state of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_nature) scenario.

## Breaking it down

If the conventional definition is insufficient, and a more fitting one yet eludes us, what about conventional interpretation? That's to say, how has society treated the concept of privacy in practice?

### Culture

As we explored previously, and as Lukács writes, culture influences the face of privacy. Cultures teach **privacy boundaries through etiquette lessons or through heuristic trial-and-error**. Embarrassment from these errors ensures they're not repeated. In Indonesia, even when given access to food or drink, a guest must wait to be invited before partaking, lest commit a faux pas. In Japan, even when permitted entry to someone's home, it's customary to announce your entry. Guests use the phrase お邪魔します as an acknowledgement that they are about to disturb the hosts personal sanctuary.

The participant culture doesn't necessarily need to be a national one either, as signaled by the symbolism of a [sock on a door handle](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=doorsock). Demonstratively, cultural practice of privacy historically requires adherence not to [budding laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_law), but to a [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract)—the sacrificing of one's freedom to invade someone else's privacy in return for respect for their own.

### Hardship

Hardship, such as economic, also influences where we may draw, or not draw, privacy boundaries. Where space is limited, cohabitation with lax privacy may be necessary. Where resources are scarce, individuals may feel inclined to hide rations. When shelter is lacking, more intimate sleeping arrangements maintain body-heat. This extends to other periods of hardship such as wars, disasters, penal confinement, hospitalization, or voluntary activities like camping.

### Period

Additionally, era and available technology also influence privacy. For instance, Ancient Rome had devised early sewerage systems. As this was not yet available to all households, [public latrines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation_in_ancient_Rome#Public_latrines) were commonplace. Some privacy sacrifices brought by innovation are instead voluntary. Self-expression of ideals or political leanings motivate this; the success of the bikini and gay pride are exemplary.

## What is privacy *really*?

What privacy *really is* is complicated. As we've seen, it involves:

* Freedom to regulate exposure of aspects of oneself
* Immunity to expressions of power overriding that regulatory freedom
* Adherence by and for society to a social contract
* Reasonable expectations per circumstances

To tackle then the challenge of a fitting definition of privacy: ** *freedom within society to regulate, where reasonable, matters pertaining to oneself without fear of forceful or deceitful seizure or intrusion* **.

In part 2, the question of responsibility for privacy will be addressed.
