title: Statement regarding the August 2019 Veil Zerocoin exploit
description: 'In August of 2019, the Veil network experienced a Zerocoin attack. This article contains the project statement regarding this incident.'

## Background

In April 2019, ZCoin experienced an attack on their Zerocoin payment system. The attack found critical flaws in the underlying cryptography of the Zerocoin library (libZerocoin). This library is used by all coins that use Zerocoin, including Veil. The flaw unfortunately was not easily fixed, and requires fundamental changes to the way Zerocoin operates. 

At this point in time, most cryptocurrency projects that use Zerocoin disabled any further use of the protocol. Veil, however, was in a situation that required continued temporary use of Zerocoin, since its proof of stake system is based on Zerocoin.

Veil placed Zerocoin into a de-anonymized mode that allowed the Zerocoin payment system to continue to function, but with the caveat that it would no longer provide any privacy. The fixes implemented by Veil were enough to prevent the existing attack that was launched on ZCoin from being launched successfully against Veil.

Veil has been preparing its final step away from Zerocoin by changing the privacy-based proof of stake consensus system to utilize the RingCT protocol instead of the Zerocoin protocol.

## August 2019 exploit

Unfortunately the final step away from Zerocoin had not come soon enough, and in August 2019 an attacker has been able to create a mutation of the attack that took place on ZCoin’s network and use it against Veil, allowing the execution of “fake spends” that effectively resulted in theft of coins, primarily in the 10K Zerocoin accumulator.

According to the team's audit, the scope of the theft was 8 million Veil. (TBC)

For affected users, the result is that their wallet will report the presence of Zerocoins, but which can’t be spent.

## Veil Project response

Once the exploit was detected, we quickly identified its nature and will address it with two immediate updates. 

1. The first, available now, fixes the exploit, thereby removing further network exposure. This is a mandatory update that all Veil users are urged to [immediately download and install](https://github.com/Veil-Project/veil/releases).

2. The second, available shortly after the first, will return Zerocoin redemption to its normal state. This will involve adding back the stolen balance to the Zerocoin pools. 

Once these two releases are made, we will notify exchanges and mining pools that it's safe to resume normal trading and operations.

## Adjustment of the Veil emission schedule

Adding to the accumulator balances will accelerate the planned emission schedule for Veil. To maintain the same long-term emission schedule, two steps will be taken.

1. First, the network will remove the originally-planned “Founders Reward” for years two through five.

2. Second, the remaining portion will be covered by “burning” some excess that the project has accumulated in its Operations Budget, i.e. Veil funds dedicated to project operations, but which haven’t been spent.

In light of this attack, the project is accelerating its move away from Zerocoin. We will first release a wallet in which RingCT can be staked, and Zerocoin staking will be deprecated. Then, we will make a second release that enforces the movement of all Zerocoin to RingCT. (Of course, later we will release Sonic.)

## Interim security

A natural question to ask is: Between the current and RingCT releases, is the Veil network vulnerable to further Zerocoin attacks? The answer is nuanced. 

Until our transition, Veil will be exposed to any new flaws discovered in the Zerocoin protocol, as will all Zerocoin-based networks. It is impossible to know whether a new flaw will be discovered, but given the demonstrated susceptibility of Zerocoin-based protocols (relative to other networks), we would recommend to consider avoiding the minting of 10K Zerocoins in the interim. 

That would at least reduce the economic *exposure* of any attack that might happen before we transition to RingCT.

## Concluding remarks

It is extremely unfortunate that the Veil network was exposed to this attack, before we were able to transition away from Zerocoin. It is our hope that the Veil community appreciates the measures we have taken to respond to the incident, and the sacrifices made by the founder and operations team to ensure no users will lose any funds. 

And on behalf of the entire Veil team, we sincerely appreciates the continued trust of our community. Despite this incident, we are working towards truly remarkable technology, and supporting infrastructure, that will allow Veil to compete to become the world’s leading privacy-focused cryptocurrency. In the words of our founder, this movement is a marathon, not a sprint. 

We remain committed to that journey, and believe great things will come to those who join us.
