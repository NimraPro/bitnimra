intro: Ben is a full-stack developer involved in cryptocurrency since 2010. Bitcoin caught Ben's attention by being decentralized and solving the critical problem of double-spending, which Ben felt held back other digital currencies. Ben is experienced in Angular, Typescript, and Node, and specializes in UI custom component development. His talent for UI tools and interfaces makes Ben an asset for Veil development, where his contributions help bridge the divide between developer and user.
