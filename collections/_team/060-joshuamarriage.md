intro: Joshua is a founding partner of Privacy Express, a venture studio focused on helping privacy enhancing technologies find product market fit. Their flagship project, Pip, enhances consumer applications with next-level personal data privacy, security and convenience. Josh has experience as an international speaker at events such as Anarchapulco, and has been a long time privacy advocate, previously as Global Spokesperson for CloakCoin. He started his career as an electrotechnologist, later moving into computer systems engineering and eventually finding his way to crypto as many did, through a curiosity for the dark markets. After a beard related venture, a brush with online fame and first-hand experience being compromised, he turned his full attention to privacy.
