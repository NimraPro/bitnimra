intro: Sean started in crypto in December 2017, but has been involved in computing since the 1980s, telecommunications since the 1970s and digital currencies since about 2000. Sean's main job at Veil is been providing technical support in almost any area, basically what he's been doing since the mid-1980s! Sean has a great sense of humour, but his principle goal is to help Veil users gain control over their Veil wallets and related processes. Misdirection or misunderstandings from any source causing confusion or creating unwanted outcomes are his primary enemies.
