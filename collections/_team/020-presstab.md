intro: Tom was introduced to blockchain distributed ledger technology in 2012 while completing an economics degree. Although it was initially Bitcoin’s monetary policy that drew him in, Tom tinkered with mining and code contributions and his understanding and knowledge rapidly grew. Today Tom is a leading expert in blockchain software development, particularly known for his trail-blazing in proof-of-stake consensus, privacy protocols, and deterministic decentralized systems. As lead blockchain architect, Tom spearheads Veil’s innovations, boldly navigating the bleeding edge of blockchain technology.
