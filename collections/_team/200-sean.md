intro: Sean started in crypto in December 2017, although first used digital currencies around 2000, having been involved professionally in computing and information systems since the 1980s, and radio communications as a hobby from the CB Radio boom in 1977 until 1995. Sean’s role with Veil is primarily providing technical support, an area he’s worked in since the mid-1980s, though he also contributes heavily in product testing. Sean’s principle goal is to help Veil users gain control over their Veil wallets and related processes. Sean will tell you misdirection or misunderstandings from any source causing confusion or creating unwanted outcomes are his primary enemies.
