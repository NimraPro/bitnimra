intro: A C, C++, Rust, and JS/TS programmer, Mimir has been involved in Bitcoin since the early days, and has helped found, fund, or develop several large-scale projects since. He has primarily been involved in blockchain core protocols, ensuring they make for a sound and secure network. Mimir is very selective about projects he works with, choosing to dedicate his time to those he sees as interesting and ambitious. When such a project appears he immerses himself in it, contributing his veteran expertise and learning all he can.
