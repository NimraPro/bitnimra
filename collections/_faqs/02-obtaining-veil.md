There are, in principle, four primary ways to obtain veil:

- You can mine for veil via Veil's Proof-of-Work consensus system.
- You can purchase veil on a centralized or decentralized exchange.
- You earn veil as a reward by “staking” it in your wallet.
- You can perform “bounty” work for the project, receiving veil as compensation.
