There are, in principle, four primary ways to obtain Veil:

- During its Proof-of-Work phase, you can mine Veil.
- You can purchase Veil on a centralized or decentralized exchange.
- You earn Veil by “staking” it in your wallet.
- You can perform “bounty” work for the project, receiving Veil as compensation.
