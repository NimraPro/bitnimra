All existing privacy coins expose users to trade-offs and compromises. Some offer always-on privacy, but are based on technologies that may not prove sufficiently anonymous in the long-term. Others, based on advanced cryptography, allow for non-private transactions, which tends to confound and confuse their users.

Veil is working to offer an unprecedented level of always-on privacy and anonymity. When Veil's roadmap is completed, you will never have to worry about accidentally making a non-private transaction. Furthermore, in the interest of long-term viability, the Veil network is designed to provide funding for its ongoing operations as well as continued research and development in the fields of cryptography and blockchain technologies.

In our view, the combination of uncompromising privacy technology, with a network designed for sustainability, will make Veil one of the most compelling cryptocurrencies in the world.
