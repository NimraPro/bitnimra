title: Why have an initial, and time-limited, Proof-of-Work phase?

To achieve wide coin distribution, Veil has decided to supplement its Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism during the first year with Proof-of-Work mining, using the ASIC-resistant X16RT algorithm, allowing anyone with NVIDIA or AMD graphics cards to solo mine or pool mine Veil.

This time frame may be extended for even wider distribution, but only if no ASICs emerge for X16RT, and pending public discussion. After this coin distribution phase, the network will switch to a purely Proof-of-Stake system.
