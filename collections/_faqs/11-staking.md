title: What is “staking”, and how does it work?

Veil’s hybrid consensus systems includes “Proof-of-Stake”, in which individual coin holders, who have “staking” enabled in their wallets, can compete to process the network’s transaction blocks. After each one-minute block processing period, actively staking wallets compete for validation based on the amount of veil that is staked in the wallet. The chosen wallet, after successfully validating the current block of network transactions, receives veil as compensation for the work done.

What makes Veil’s PoS implementation particularly attractive to those who value anonymity is that it can exclusively be done through Zerocoin, allowing Veil users to earn a yield on their holdings, while keeping the amount staked private, through a zero-knowledge proof.

To stake, all you have to do is be fully synced and unlock your wallet for staking. This will allow your Zerocoin veil to stake.
