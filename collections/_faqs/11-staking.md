title: What is “staking”, and how does it work?
ref: staking

Veil’s hybrid consensus systems includes “Proof-of-Stake”, in which individual coin holders, who have “staking” enabled in their wallets, can compete to process the network’s transaction blocks. After each one-minute block processing period, actively staking wallets compete for validation based on the amount of veil that is staked in the wallet. The chosen wallet, after successfully validating the current block of network transactions, receives veil as compensation for the work done.

To stake, all you have to do is be fully synced and unlock your wallet for staking. This will allow your Zerocoin veil to stake.

If your zerocoins have been minted from RingCT in Veil, then the privacy benefits of RingCT will flow-down to your zerocoin staking rewards.
