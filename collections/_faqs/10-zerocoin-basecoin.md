title: What is the difference between Zerocoin and Basecoin?
ref: zero_base

In Zerocoin-based networks, Zerocoins exist in fixed denominations, e.g 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc. Without going into detail, this provides anonymity in a similar way cash exists in fixed denominations. Basecoin is that portion of your wallet’s balance, that’s not convertible to Zerocoin denominations.

For example, say you had one 100 Zerocoin Veil, and purchased something that cost 7 Veil. Your 100 Zerocoin Veil would be sent to the network, and you’d receive 93 Basecoin Veil in return. Your Veil wallet would convert 90 of those Basecoin to nine Zerocoin denominations of 10, leaving 3 Basecoin Veil in your wallet. The Basecoin balance in your wallet is commonly referred to as your “change”.

Something important to remember is that in Veil, contrary to other Zerocoin-based networks, the Basecoin state is also anonymized; in our case, with the use of RingCT technology. This results in what we call "always-on" privacy—such that the spending of *both* Zerocoin and Basecoin Veil are protected.
