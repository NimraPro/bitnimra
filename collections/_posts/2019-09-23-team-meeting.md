On September 19, a Veil team meeting occurred in which all development groups reported status updates, and we wanted to pass these updates on to our community.

- Veil's new cryptographer, **Paul Moonshine** presented a draft of his work on **zk-Snarks and Sonic** for Veil. Now that Paul is working full-time for Veil (since July), this work is progressing well, and we continue to expect to release the Sonic version of Veil during 2020.

- In the meantime, **Presstab** reported continued progress on the forthcoming version of Veil, that removes Zerocoin completely, and provides **first-of-its-kind staking with RingCT**. 

- Due to the emergency full-time attention required of Presstab in response to the recent Zerocoin exploit, the RingCT work has been slightly delayed, and we now expect to announce a **public RingCT testnet within one month's time**. Also, at that time, we'll post a blog update with technical details about the how the Zerocoin-to-RingCT migration will happen, and how RingCT staking will work.

- Presstab also reported activity in the **recruitment of new development team members**, as well as expanding our internal quality assurance processes to include more automated testing. This will naturally result in a slower pace of development, but as is clear to everyone, this is a trade-off worth making.

- On the issue of recruiting, the success of our **development bounty program** was highlighted, as it has led to the permanent placement of two highly capable developers into the team.

- In parallel to the RingCT work, other Veil developers are working on forthcoming **updates to the current Zerocoin-based wallet**, addressing stability issues reported by the community.

- Veil developer **mimir** reported great progress on a **Veil-specific version of Electrum**, built from the ground up and including features for mobile wallets to self-validate blocks.

- Veil founder, **James Burden**, reported on behind-the-scenes strategic activities, including a **Veil-based debit card**, as well as exclusive **Veil/BTC exchange and OTC options**. Although these partnerships and agreements are not yet formalized, we couldn't be more excited about the Veil ecosystem expansion opportunities on the horizon.

And with that, we wrap up this Veil update. We'll continue to post updates as things progress, and as always, if you have any questions or comments in the meantime, feel free to reach out to the team in Discord.

Onwards!
