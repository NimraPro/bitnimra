## Hi My Name Is… 

My name is Lori Brown and I am thankful to have the opportunity to explore my passion for cryptocurrency while documenting my journey with Veil. I am not new to the business aspects of the crypto-journalism world. I have been creating content about blockchain technology for a few years. In that time I have researched and crunched numbers with the industry's notorious and glorious best. I have been invited to far away places and I have written content that has traveled the globe. Naturally, when I saw the chance to create content for a new privacy coin called Veil I was excited, and it seemed to be a perfect fit for my level of knowledge and passion.  


## A Turbulent Start 

Upon my arrival in the virtual halls of The Veil Project everyone was cordial, and attentive to my questions, and I thought I did very well in the early communications with the team. As time progressed it became apparent that my peers were not yet impressed. My first few attempts to write something juicy about Veil were quickly torn to shreds by my peers- and they meant well, but it was a rude awakening. 


## Intellectual Intimidation 

While working on a written assignment It seemed as if my team agreed that I simply did not yet have the technical knowledge needed to write decent material for this ultra- intellectual group and their intricate coin project. Evidence of this came in the form of suggestions, mostly.  It was suggested that I study more of the technical documentation from coins similar to Veil and I was even told that I should not bring too much attention to my lack of knowledge by one peer. 


## Bright Light Through The Veil  

It is against my natural instinct to "lay low" so instead, I worked painfully through a handful of great write-ups. Even with all of my efforts, I knew there was something more that I could offer the public in terms of fun, fresh content. I felt like I was putting out reading materials that were dull, even if they were sculpted through the scrutiny of the Veil team. I approached members of the team with my frustrations. I found myself saying "If you guys would just allow me to be myself in my writing, you would see my value."  

## One Thing Led To Another  
To my surprise and delight, I have been blessed with a corner of my own to use my true voice while navigating the various parts of the Veil Project. I am tasked with conveying the stories of Veil in a way that helps to simplify the experience for a general audience.

Welcome to Lori's corner! We will explore the intricate details of Veil piece by piece, sifting through everything from development to team personalities. I look forward to entertaining you as we unravel the mysteries of Veil technologies. Cheers. 

## P.S. 

Special thanks to the entire team for all your hard work and thanks for letting me be me. The views expressed in Lori’s corner will not always reflect the views of Veil. Opinion is that of the writer.
