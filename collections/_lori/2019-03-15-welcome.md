## Hi My Name Is 

My name is Lori Brown and I am thankful to have spent the last few years exploring my passion for cryptocurrency while documenting the journey in news, blogs and various writing projects. Things became interesting when a unique opportunity presented itself while I was traveling to a distant convention. 

## All Signs Pointed To Veil

While traveling to the city of Seoul, in South Korea, thousands of miles from my home in Las Vegas,  I learned  of a privacy coin that caught my attention. called Veil.  Ironically I found that the creators of this fascinating coin-in-the-making were also from Las Vegas. 

Upon returning home  I received a message from an old friend that I had lost contact with over the years.  
His words were skeptical.  He asked “Ok, what’s up chicky?”

Confusion was my initial reaction. Then it changed to shock. My old friend James just happened to be the creator of PIVX,  the coin for which I was conducting an interview.  Wow. He also was the creator of The Veil Project. My mind was blown. Hearing that I had been writing for the last few years and seeing my recent work,  I was offered a chance to join the Veil team. I did not hesitate to accept. 

## I Accepted The Challenge 

Its not often that someone needs to travel across the globe to find a great job around the corner from home. Laugh if you want to, but with all of the unlikely circumstances leading to the moment I was in, I figured it was the universe showing me my destiny.  Although Veil is more advanced than any project I have written about, I am here because all signs pointed to Veil.
