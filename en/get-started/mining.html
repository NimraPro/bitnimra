title: Veil Mining
intro: To provide for wide distribution, the Veil network will launch with a hybrid consensus approach including both Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work mining.

  <p>Our mining objective is that anyone with an NVIDIA or AMD graphics card can participate, either as a solo miner or as part of a collective mining pool. The hashing algorithm chosen for our Proof-of-Work phase is <strong>X16RT</strong>, a Veil modification of the original X16R algorithm introduced by the Ravencoin project. By rotating among 16 different algorithms, X16RT promotes maximum mining decentralization by resisting the usage of ASICs.</p>
  <p>Leading up to the launch, the Veil team working on mining, including well-known marsmensch, has evaluated a number of existing X16R NVIDIA and AMD miner implementations, and where necessary has developed modifications relevant to Veil.</p>
  <p>For the mainnet launch, we will update this page with detailed mining instructions for Veil.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Getting setup at one of our two initial pools, one operated by the project itself and one operated at Suprnova.</li>
  <li>Getting setup for solo mining.</li>
  <li>Getting setup for cloud mining at Nicehash and MiningRigRentals.</li>
  </ul>
