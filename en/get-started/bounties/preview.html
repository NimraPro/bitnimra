  <p>
  Development tasks that available for bounty rewards are defined as "<strong><code>bounty</code></strong>" tagged <strong>GitHub Issues</strong> in the Veil GitHub repository, and are listed below along with the price in Veil that has been assigned by the project.
  </p>
  <p>
  The participation procedure is as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Availability</strong> — Only tasks that are in the state <strong>available</strong> are available to be picked up for development. Tasks in other states have already been accepted and are being worked on. </li>
  <li><strong>Application</strong> — If you intend to work on an available task, post a note on the GitHub Issue, tagging the developer <strong>@presstab</strong>, and include an initial description of your approach to addressing the task.</li>
  <li><strong>Assignment</strong> — If your proposed approach is accepted, @presstab will make a note of that on the GitHub Issue, and will change the state to <strong>assigned</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Interaction</strong> — As you work on the task, you can post questions and feedback as notes on the issue. In addition, interactive discussion with the Veil development team is available through the dedicated <strong><a href="https://discord.gg/EfFUbEy">Veil Development Discord</a></strong></li>
  <li><strong>Progress</strong> — As the state of work progresses, you should tag @presstab in a note, requesting to update the state of work. The available states are: <strong>assigned</strong>, <strong>analysis</strong>, <strong>development</strong>, <strong>integration</strong>, <strong>testing</strong> and <strong>completed</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Completion & Payment</strong> — Once a task has been successfully completed, you will be paid the bounty in Veil.</li>
