As regular followers are aware, a recent series of exploits targeting the core protocol implementation library upon which most Zerocoin protocol cryptocurrencies rely, had the following two impacts on Veil Project:

1. We had to issue an emergency wallet release, that while protecting our user's funds from the exploit, carried the downside of removing the anonymity feature of Zerocoin.

2. It forced us to make the difficult decision to, in the interest of our long-term mission, move away from Zerocoin as the foundation of our privacy protocol.

We have been humbled at the support for this decision, and the implicit vote of confidence, that our community has demonstrated. In the spirit of keeping you informed, we've got some exciting news to share.

## Protocol requirements and an emphasis on simplicity

The research for a new core protocol took place around the following set of requirements:

- Full-time privacy
- Only private transactions (one coin type)
- Private mining via the X16RT algorithm
- Private staking
- IP privacy (Dandelion)
- Fast transaction validation
- Minimized transaction sizes
- No denominations

The second requirement came from a lesson learned from the current Veil protocol, and that is the importance of simplicity. The current protocol, to provide full-time anonymity, involves Zerocoin, RingCT and CT, and this resulted in incidental complexity in the wallet user experience. The future privacy protocol will specifically target to avoid such complexity.

## Identification of our new core privacy protocol

Based on the above requirements, the Veil development team, along with a number of individuals who are in discussion to join Veil Labs, have conducted an intense investigation into possible replacements for Zerocoin. 

This investigation concluded with a core architecture for our new privacy protocol that we are excited to share with you now. 

- The foundation of the Veil privacy protocol will be based on the work done by the **Zerocash** project. Similar to Veil's original protocol, Zerocash leveraged the stability of Bitcoin and the base anonymity of Zerocoin. Whereas Veil complemented Zerocoin with RingCT, Zerocash achieved full-time anonymity through "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge", or zk-SNARKS, and an associated "decentralized anonymous payment" (or DAP) scheme. You can read more about Zerocash in the project's [white paper](http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-extended-20140518.pdf).

- Veil will improve on Zerocash by replacing the Zerocash proof system, with the advanced work known as **Sonic**, from cryptographer, and long-time colleague, Mary Maller and her associates. Sonic proofs are zk-SNARKS from linear-size universal and updatable structured reference strings. Key benefits of Sonic will include far-fewer trade-offs in the protocol's "trusted setup", as well as improvements in computational scalability. You can learn more about Sonic in the project's [white paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/099.pdf).

We realize that's a lot to digest. For the moment, we simply wanted to outline the exciting new architecture of the Veil core privacy protocol, but you can be sure we'll be posting additional details and information in the coming weeks and months.

## Fixing Zerocoin in the meantime

A full transition to our new privacy protocol is a complex and time-consuming endeavor. As we mentioned in a previous article, we estimate a minimum of six months.

Recognizing the importance of privacy to our original Veil investors and early adopters, the Veil development team has also identified an approach to fixing the current Zerocoin attack vectors, and will be releasing an updated wallet soon, restoring full anonymity to Veil's Zerocoin implementation. For the curious, the solution is found in "non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for composite statements", as outline in this [technical publication](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/557.pdf).

Some might question our decision to expend the additional time, effort and cost on Zerocoin, if we'll be migrating away from it in the future. As mentioned above, this decision is to respect the privacy needs and intents of our early adopters, during the interim period as we develop the new network.

## Onward and upward!

We couldn't be more excited about the architecture that's been identified for the future Veil core privacy protocol. While the Zerocoin exploits, and their impact on the Veil roadmap, have certainly represented a setback, we now believe that in the long-run the situation will prove to be a blessing in disguise, as the new architecture will provide equivalent anonymity, improved scalability â€” all within a far simpler user experience.

Be sure to keep your eye on this space in the coming weeks and months, as we provide updates, news and additional technical insights into the forthcoming Veil core protocol, as well as details in the process of migration as they become available. And as always, if you have any questions or comments, don't hesitate to contact the team in Discord or Telegram.
