## Introduction & objectives

Across the landscape of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, a number of general approaches have been taken, each with its own benefits and trade-offs.

The Veil Project is working to improve the state of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies by creating a secure, highly anonymous coin that provides full-time privacy. In addition, Veil offers a user experience suited to the masses with self-funding to support long-term research and development by a dedicated team of researchers and blockchain developers.

## Technology

- At its core, Veil is built on the world’s most secure blockchain software, **Bitcoin version 0.17.1**.

- In order to provide for “always-on” privacy, Veil added **RingCT** privacy from Particl to its Basecoin transactions, such that all transaction components in the Veil network are  as anonymous as technology today can provide for.

- Veil originally integrated the **Zerocoin** protocol, based on **zero-knowledge proofs**. However, this technology is currently being deprecated in the Veil network, due to the [Zerocoin insecurities discovered in 2019](https://veil-project.com/blog/2019-09-07-exploit-update/).

- Today’s version of Veil still includes a de-anonymized, safe, implementation of Zerocoin; however, the upcoming release of Veil 1.2 will remove Zerocoin completely, moving to an industry-first, fully anonymous RingCT-based staking implementation.

- Veil implements a hybrid **Proof-of-Work** (PoW) and **Proof-of-Stake** (PoS) consensus system, providing both fair distribution, and an unprecedented level of protocol security.

- Veil is the only protocol in the industry that support [three separate proof-of-work algorithms](https://veil-project.com/blog/pow-update/), in addition its proof-of-stake algorithm, thereby providing fair distribution to ASICs, GPUs and CPUs.

- Support for the **Dandelion protocol** makes it nearly impossible to trace a transaction back to its source node on the network.

- **Bulletproofs** technology will be adopted to ensure minimal transaction sizes.

- Finally, research is ongoing into cutting-edge **Supersonic**, the first practical, trustless, and efficiently verifiable zero-knowledge proofs, which are smaller than 10 kilobytes and take only milliseconds to verify even for the most complex statements. Should this research prove fruitful, future generations of the Veil protocol would take advantage of this advanced technology.

## User experience

Veil places great emphasis on user experience, and in this regard will support a number of experiential benefits.

For example, to avoid the necessity of file backups, the Veil wallet supports a single BIP-0039/BIP-0044 **Deterministic Seed** from which its entire wallet can be restored, including both Basecoin and Zerocoin transactions.

And beginning with the RingCT protocol release, Veil will release a wallet, **Veil X**, that’s been designed and built from the ground-up with an emphasis on a friendly user experience.

## The Veil emission schedule

As summarized in the table, the Veil coin emission schedule includes:

- A declining and capped contribution to the **founder**, to recover the seed investment from which the project has been bootstrapped.

- A declining but uncapped contribution to the **Veil Labs**, to provide for ongoing research and development in privacy technologies related to cryptocurrencies.

- A front-heavy, declining and uncapped contribution to the **Veil operations budget**, funding operations activities such as core network and wallet development, project management, online user support, bounties, marketing and partnerships.

- It should be noted that the funds allocated to the Labs and operations budgets *will not stake*, meaning those funds will not disadvantage those staking in the network. Salaries paid are however free to stake.
